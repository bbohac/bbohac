# Bastian Bohac

Software engineer with a focus on maintainable .NET applications and clear architectural decision-making.  
I work on systems that should remain understandable and adaptable over time, without unnecessary complexity.

This GitHub account contains:
- practical examples of different architectural styles in .NET
- small experiments and prototypes exploring design and implementation approaches
- documentation-driven development using ADRs, reasoning and trade-offs
- front-end projects and utilities using React, React Native, HTML and CSS

Areas I work in:
- backend development with .NET, C#, ASP.NET Core
- front-end development with React and React Native
- web fundamentals such as HTML and CSS
- architectural patterns, modularity and system design
- testing strategies and automation

My general approach:
- prefer simple, understandable solutions over complex abstractions
- choose architecture based on context rather than trends
- value clarity, consistency and long-term maintainability
- aim for code that is easy to read, reason about and evolve

This profile is primarily a place to explore ideas, document approaches and share code that reflects how I think about building software.
